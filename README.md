# YouTube Delayed Gratification

A browser extension that blocks your ability to watch YouTube videos right away. Queue videos to watch after a configurable delay (minutes to hours). Stop impulsive viewing!

YouTube is not something I want to cut out entirely, yet I can't be trusted with unrestricted access. I've tried other screen-time limiters or YouTube blockers, but many are too restrictive or don't work very well: Fundamentally, I gain a lot of value out of YouTube! There are a lot of incredible videos out there. This extension is a compromise to help you limit the slop, while keeping as much of the value as possible.

TODO

 - Show the queue on the front page with timers
 - Don't block Music videos
 - instantly free one video from queue every day (builds up?, configurable)
